# Nine-Mens-Morris

Rules

(1) To begin with the board is empty.

(2) Players decide who will be white by tossing a coin. Traditionally white goes first.

(3) At each turn a player places one of their counters on one of the points on the board.

(4) Each player aims to make "mills" which are vertical or horizontal lines of three counters in a row.

(5) When a player makes a mill, they can remove one of their opponent's pieces.

(6) Players take turns to play a piece of their own colour on any unoccupied point until all eighteen pieces have been played.

(7) When all pieces have been placed, in each turn the player can move one piece along a line to an adjacent point.

(8) Captured pieces are never replayed onto the board and remain captured for the remainder of the game.

(9) The game is finished when a played loses, either by having only two pieces left or by being unable to move.


Aim
To win the game you must capture your opponent's pieces until they have less than three pieces left and are unable to play a move.
